This is the first React project i worked on.
It uses Baasic as a backend and database.

It's a simple client application for displaying/updating/creating types of cars/car manufacturers.

To get started when cloning the repo.

Run *npm install* to download all the necessary packages.

Run npm *npm run start* to run the application.
